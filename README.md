# C++20 Playground

A toy repository dedicated to exploring the C++20 new features as they're gradually getting wider support by the compilers. Alongside playing around with C++20, will also try to get more hands-on experience with CMake.

*This project is probably misconfigured for MSVC and Windows at this point.*
